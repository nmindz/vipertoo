Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix. Wine can run on top of Linux, Mac, FreeBSD, and Solaris. There is also a port to Android.

Wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs. Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100%% non-Microsoft code.
However Wine can optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available.Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code to Unix as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified Windows programs to run on x86-based platforms (NB: an Arm port has also been developed).

Wine Staging is the testing area of winehq.org. It contains bug fixes and features, which have not been integrated into the development branch yet.
The idea of Wine Staging is to provide experimental features faster to end users and to give developers the possibility to discuss and improve their patches before they are integrated into the main branch.
For this Wine variant - the external Wine Staging patchset is always applied when building Wine.
